# Escalating an issue

Sometimes as a Learn expert, you will encounter questions that are beyond your scope to answer. In these cases, you'll escalate these issues to the larger Learn team via the #escalation channel.

## Types of Escalations

There are four types of escalation - environment escalation, programming escalation, platform escalation, and personal escalation.

### Environment escalation

- If someone is not yet a paying customer, do whatever you can to get them set up on the IDE (including escalating IDE issues), but if you can't get them going on the IDE **we do not provide support for other environment setups for students that are not paying (in the intro tracks)**

- If there is an environment issue you can't solve, here's what you should do **BEFORE** escalating the issue:
  - If they're on the Learn IDE, check out the [Learn IDE guide](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/learn-support/blob/master/learn-ide.md) to see if that covers the issue
  - If the user is using a Mac, check out the [Mac OSX environment guide](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/learn-support/blob/master/environment-setup.md#mac-osx-setup) to see if that covers the issue
  - If the user is on Ubuntu, check out the [Ubuntu Setup](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/learn-support/blob/master/environment-setup.md#ubuntu-setup) to see if that covers the issue
  - If the user is on Nitrous, ask them to move to the Learn IDE- we don't provide support for Nitrous.
  
If none of these cover the issues above, please post a single comment into the #escalation slack channel in the Flatiron Staff organization with a link to the question and a 1-2 paragraph summary of the problem and what you've tried.

### Programming escalation

- There's a technical issue that you can't resolve for a student
- Make sure you've got them to push their latest code to GitHub (you can have them do `learn save`) and that you can replicate the issue by cloning locally.
- Post a link to the students question  and include a 1-2 paragraph description of what you're tried and where they are.

### Platform escalation

Platform escalation is when it appears there is a problem with Learn. Some examples are:

- The expert chat is totally empty
- Pages that you should be able to get to are 500ing

If you see any of these issues there may be a problem on the Learn side. Please make sure to try refreshing your page and fully quitting and re-opening Chrome before escalating. If the issue does not resolve, make sure that when you post in escalation you include a screen shot that has what is going on in the dev console. 

### Personal escalation

- Students get a little frustrated all the time, but if a student seems to be really disheartened, or if they mention even in passing that they might (quit | leave | stop) the course, immediately send a DM to @avidor, @kaitlin, and @peterbell in the flatiron staff slack. Paste the message that concerned you and a link to the question so we can easily get in touch and review. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. 
- If in doubt, send too many of these. If necessary we'll refine the instructions but we'd rather get too many false positives than fail to help a student who's having a hard time.

## Before You Escalate! Pre Escalation Checklist

In addition to identifying the type of escalation and going through any suggestions, there are a few things you must do for the first three categories (environment, platform, programming):

- [ ] Make sure you or the student (whoever is experiencing the issue) has tried fully refreshing the page
- [ ] Browse the reference guide repo to see if you can find a solution
- [ ] If you cannot find a solution **SEARCH** this repo using key words and error messages
- [ ] If the student is having an issue in the Learn IDE, you should be able to re-create this same issue **IN YOUR OWN LEARN IDE**.
- [ ] Do an `@here` in the `#learn-experts` channel to see if any of the other learn experts can help.

## How to Escalate an Issue

Once you have tried all the pre-escalation steps and have come to the conclusion that this issue requires escalation, there is some information you'll need to provide:

- [ ] The students github name if they have one or their email if they don't
- [ ] What is the issue or error they are seeing / experiencing
- [ ] What environment is this issue happening in? (IDE? OS?)
- [ ] What have you already tried? And what was the result?

Post all of this in **ONE MESSAGE** in the #escalation channel on Slack. Please do not post this as multiple messages like a chat.

### Things that DO NOT belong in escalation

- [Lights not working](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/learn-support/blob/master/common-learn-questions.md#example-students-have-trouble-getting-their-lights-to-turn-green-when-they-fork-a-lab)
- Student changes their github username. Tell the student to change their github username back to what it was before (changing your username breaks a lot of things). Then send an email to avidor@flatironschool.com explaining the situation. Make sure the email has the original github username and what the student is trying to change it to. Some one will reach out to the student with what we have to do to properly change their username.

## Admissions Re-Assignment

Occasionally someone asks non-technical questions such as "How long does this course take to complete?", "Do you offer scholarships?", "Can you explain the job guarantee to me?", etc... If if you feel like you know the answer, please do not try and answer these questions. Simply let the student know that this is a great question for our admissions team and that you're going to close this chat question and forward the question to them. Once you get confirmation from the student that this is OK, hit the Assign button and expert-chat will take care of the rest!
